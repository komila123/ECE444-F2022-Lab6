TDD has several pros and cons. 

Pros: 
- It helps dividing the code in several parts between teammates
- It's easier to document the code that was written
- Ensures no single point of failure
- Each feature can be tested on its own, independently of the rest of the code, which makes debugging a lot less time consuming and a better test coverage of the overall code

Cons:
- Can be tricky to implement in some cases
- Can be time consuming to learn how to write unit tests depending on the programming language
- Can decrease the team's motivation
- Has to be uniform across all the team members
- Adds a lot of time to the implementation of every feature and code review
- Need to de updated ad much as their associated code
